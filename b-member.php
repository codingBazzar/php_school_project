          <p>Schools these days are not only meant to attain information and knowledge only, rather they are platforms for
             collaboration of thoughts and ideas. At kala kunj school, we believe that the true strength in our classroom lies
             in collaboration of learners, not in the knowledge of one Expert. Aristotle once said that “Educating the mind without
             educating the heart is not education”. Even as we impart the education to match the advancement in technology and processes,
             we guide our children towards right principles, ethics and moral values. We offer our students a stress-free learning environment
             which encourages creativity and critical thinking. Our unique teaching and learning process with a proper blend of theory and
             practice crosses the boundaries of nations towards global excellence.</p>

          <p>Educational institutions all around the world along with the aspirations of students and parents have undergone critical
            transformations with time. At kala kunj school we aspire to provide top quality education to all, with a well-balanced and
            relevant curriculum. At kala kunj school we believe that true education is a right blend of Intelligence and character,
             we educate our students to maximize their innate potential along with positive social behavior, thus developing them as
             global citizens.We value regular contact with parents / guardians, and regard the home-school partnership as an essential
             part of the education process. We are always looking for new ways to involve parents in the life of the school. We are always
             open to refreshing views and suggestions which can add more value to the students of our school.</p>
